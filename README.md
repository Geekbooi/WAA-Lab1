focuses web applications in an enterprise setting. An enterprise application is a large software system designed to operate in a large organization such as a corporation or a government. Enterprise applications are complex, scalable, component-based, distributed and mission critical. This course, CS545, focuses on the front end or presentation layer of an enterprise web application. CS544 Enterprise Architecture is a companion course that focuses on the back end or business layer, including business logic, transactions, and persistence. CS472, Web Application Programming, is a prerequisite course that covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, servlets and JSP.

The course teaches principles and patterns that are general across platforms and frameworks. The course will examine and work with the two predominant Java web frameworks, Java Server Faces (JSF) and SpringMVC. JSF is a component based framework and is the official presentation framework specification for the Java Enterprise Edition technology stack. SpringMVC is part of the Core Spring framework and has become the most widely used Java web framework in recent years. (4 units) Prerequisite: CS 472 or consent of the department faculty.
